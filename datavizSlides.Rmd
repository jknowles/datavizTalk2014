```{r knitrsetup,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results="hide",error=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)

## Outline

- This talk will focus on 5 graphics as an illustration of the principals of 
policy focused data visualization

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.height=2.75}
img <- readPNG("assets/ewsLITplot.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```


## The Principles

> Know thy data, and know thy audience better. 

<br>
<br>

> - What is their *question*?
> - What is their *timeframe*?
> - What are their **constraints**?
> - What is their **capacity**?


## On Audience

<br>

> Your audience can understand much more than you may think. It is all in how 
you lead them there. 

## The Barriers

<br>

- Time
- Data
- Tools
- Tech

## Yahbut - too much data 

```{r fig.cap = "Data is Everywhere", fig.align='center'}
img <- readJPEG("assets/data.jpg")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```


## Yahbut - too many priorities

![Under pressure](assets/bully.gif)


## Yahbut - unclear direction

```{r fig.cap = "Data is Everywhere", fig.align='center'}
img <- readJPEG("assets/traffic.jpg")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## The Way Out 

<br>

1. Identify your goals (strategy)
2. Explore your data and focus (analysis)
3. Focus even narrower (leadership)
4. Find the context (context)
5. Put it together (presentation)

<br>
<br>

Use the data to make a visualization that presents an argument supported by evidence. 

## Strategy: What can this data say? 

![Wisconsin FRL Map](assets/evenFRLmap.gif)

## Of Metrics and Dashboards

Widgets provide limited connection to strategy.

```{r fig.cap = "Infographic, or confusion?", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/badinfographic.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## Analyze your data to find the meaning

What is the goal of this graphic? 

![Word cloud, or clouded message?](assets/d3wordcloud.png)

## What did we learn?

- The words *obviously* and *education* were used a lot
- Some other words were frequent too
- What do the colors mean?

<br>
**What value have we provided?** 

## Exploratory vs. Explanatory

*Exploratory graphics* are what we use to understand the features of a dataset

<br>
<br>

*Explanatory graphics* are polished and annotated graphics that convey a fact or 
argument clearly

## Exploratory

```{r fig.cap = "Exploring Group Differences", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/cumlDENSmega91.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## Explanatory

```{r fig.cap = "Cumulative Assessment Density", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/cumlDENS97.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## What have we learned?

- Strong link between ACT and WKCE scores
- Not only does the mode shift with WKCE percentile, but the variation shifts as well
- Low WKCE scores mean a low chance at meeting the ACT benchmark

## An aside on complexity

- Yes, these graphics are more complex
- Explaining one complex graphic to the audience with a strong meaning is powerful
- Many superficial graphics have a harder time conveying a strong message
- In education we are fortunate to have **smart audiences**

## Leadership means making the point clear

![Student Growth in WI](assets/TESTstuplot.gif)

## What did we learn?

- Student mobility across proficiency categories is hard
- Student growth is parallel across percentiles
- Students regress as well as grow
- Assessment measures can be noisy

## Context
 
```{r fig.cap = "Showing Models", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/EWSfull.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## Context as Key

- Education viz is littered with plots without context or reference points
- Context is what creates urgency, helps focus decision making, and 
allows tradeoffs to be balanced
- Moves the conversation forward 
- Focuses us on the issue at hand
- Reduces complexity without throwing away data


## Some Solutions

```{r fig.cap = "Technology Choices in Viz", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/technologies.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## Don't Underestimate Your Audience

- 1 polished detailed graph is better than 10 simple throwaway graphs
- Provide context and remember your limits as a presenter
- Link your graphic to things leadership cares about
- If complexity is required, explain it better!

## Simulation

Skip the data
<br>

```{r fig.cap = "Density", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/HighMathGapClose.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```

## Counterfactual Modeling

Show what should be
<br>

```{r fig.cap = "Density", fig.align='center'}
img <- readPNG("assets/racegapgradFORAPRIL2014.png")
grid.raster(img, interpolate = TRUE)
```
